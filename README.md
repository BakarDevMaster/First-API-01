Import Statements and Initialization:
import necessary modules: FastAPI, HTTPException, BaseModel, and Dict.
created an instance of FastAPI called app.
define Student model using pydantic.BaseModel.
Global Variables:
initialized a list called students with some initial values.
created an empty dictionary called students (which seems to be conflicting with the previous list).
GET Endpoint for All Students:
define route handler for the endpoint /students using the @app.get decorator.
When a GET request is made to /students, it will return the students dictionary.
GET Endpoint for a Specific Student:
define another route handler for the endpoint /students/{student_id}.
This endpoint takes a student_id as a path parameter.
If the student ID exists in the students dictionary, it returns the corresponding student; otherwise, it raises an HTTP 404 exception.
POST Endpoint for Creating a New Student:
define route handler for the endpoint /students using the @app.post decorator.
When a POST request is made to /students, it expects a JSON payload representing a new student.
If the student ID already exists, it raises an HTTP 400 exception; otherwise, it adds the student to the students dictionary.
PUT Endpoint for Updating a Student:
define route handler for the endpoint /students/{student_id} using the @app.put decorator.
When a PUT request is made to this endpoint, it updates the student information if the student ID exists; otherwise, it raises an HTTP 404 exception.
DELETE Endpoint for Deleting a Student:
Youâ€™ve defined a route handler for the endpoint /students/{student_id} using the @app.delete decorator.
When a DELETE request is made to this endpoint, it removes the student with the given ID if it exists; otherwise, it raises an HTTP 404 exception.
Running the FastAPI Application:
define function called start() that runs the FastAPI application using uvicorn.
It listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 8080 and enables auto-reloading.
